A still life is a work of art depicting inanimate subject matter,
 typically either natural things such as flowers, dead animals, 
 food, rocks or shells, or man-made objects. As a genre, 
 still-life painting began with Netherlandish painting in
  the 16th and 17th centuries. The wealthy Dutch Empire's 
  trade enabled the importation of spices, sugar and exotic 
  fruits into the country, and new ingredients such as dates, 
  rice, cinnamon, ginger, nuts, and saffron became available. 
  This oil-on-panel still life from the 1620s by the Flemish artist
   Osias Beert is entitled Dishes with Oysters, Fruit, and Wine, and 
   includes a rare early depiction of sugar in art

The Armed Forces Special Weapons Project (AFSWP) was a United States 
military agency responsible for those aspects of nuclear weapons that 
remained under military control after the Manhattan Project was succeeded
 by the Atomic Energy Commission on 1 January 1947. These included the maintenance, 
 storage, security and handling of nuclear weapons, and support for nuclear weapons 
 testing. Early nuclear weapons were complex and cumbersome, and stored as components
  rather than complete devices due to the short shelf life of their lead-acid batteries 
  and modulated neutron initiators, and the heat generated by the fissile cores.
   As nuclear weapons development proceeded, mass-produced models became available 
   that were easier to store, handle, maintain and assemble, and the AFSWP became more
    involved in stockpile management, and providing administrative, technical and 
    logistical support. In 1959, the AFSWP became the Defense Atomic Support Agency (DASA), 
    a field agency of the Department of Defense.

Four are in the state of Pahang, two are in Perak, and one each are in Kedah, Negeri Sembilan, Penang and Selangor. Cameron Highlands is the largest hill station, covering 71,220 hectares (175,988 acres) of land, as well as the highest, at an elevation of 1,830 metres (6,004 ft) above sea level. The concept of a hill station in Malaysia began during the colonial period. The British were not used to the environment, especially the hot tropical weather, endemic illnesses, and mosquito breeding areas. As a result, they began looking for alternative ways to allow British people to stay in tropical countries for longer durations, as the travel distance and the British government's leave policy prevented any people who had settled in tropical countries from returning to Britain on a regular basis. Due to Malaysia's geographical factors and abundant natural beauty, the British government built hill stations in the country. The first hill station, Penang Hill (pictured), was founded in 1787 on Penang Island. (Full list...)
